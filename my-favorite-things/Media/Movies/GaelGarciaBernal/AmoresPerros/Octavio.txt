Octavio y Susana
The first segment stars Gael Garc√≠a Bernal and Vanessa Bauche as the title characters. Susana is Octavio's sister-in-law; however, Octavio is in love with her and does not like the way his brother, Ramiro, treats her. Octavio tries to persuade her to run away with him to get out from under Ramiro's abuse. Jarocho, a local thug, is happy after winning in a dog fight, so he decides to let his dog loose on some strays, but is stopped when a vagrant pulls out a machete from his junk cart; eventually, Jarocho sees Octavio's rottweiler, Cofi, wandering the streets, and lets his dog loose on it, but Cofi kills Jarocho's dog. Aware of this by his friend Jorge and needing to make money so that he and Susana can escape and start a life of their own, Octavio decides to become involved in the business of dog fighting, organized by Mauricio, owner of El Sabadaba, where the fights take place. Every time there is a fight, Jarocho enters a new dog, and everytime, Cofi kills it. After more than fifteen fights, Octavio makes enough money to run away with Susana, even paying Mauricio to get Ramiro beaten up. In revenge, Ramiro steals the money and leaves with his wife. Struggling financially, Octavio accepts a challenge by Jarocho to participate in a private fight, with no outside bets. Octavio's dog wins, but Jarocho shoots Cofi. In revenge, Octavio stabs Jarocho in the stomach. Pursued by Jarocho's thugs, Octavio finds himself in a car chase with Jorge, and the wounded dog. A collision follows; Jorge dies and Octavio is badly injured.
