A sprinkling of gold leaf looking like hell flowers
A flat piece of wrapping paper, already wrinkled, but
wrinkled again by hand, smoothed into shape by an

A painting

Collage a binding together
Of the real
Which flat colors
Tell us what heroes
really come by.

As if we were not ever able quite to include them.
His gun
does not shoot real bullets

Being done

Not a collage
A binding together, ~
Memory.
